abstract = {In patients with unstable angina, evidence of myocardial ischemia on Holter monitoring is associated with an adverse prognosis. However, the association of duration and timing of ischemia on Holter monitoring with outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTEACSs) has not been systematically evaluated. PROTECT-TIMI 30 randomized 857 patients with NSTEACSs undergoing PCI to eptifibatide plus a heparin product or bivalirudin monotherapy. Patients underwent continuous Holter monitoring following PCI, and the association between ischemia and clinical outcomes was evaluated retrospectively. Forty-three patients (5.0{\%}) had ischemia on Holter after PCI. Any ischemia was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of death or myocardial infarction (MI) within 48 hours (32.6{\%} vs 6.1{\%}, odds ratio 7.5, 95{\%} confidence interval 3.70 to 15.10, p {\textless}0.001). In patients who developed ischemia, there was a 1.44-fold increase in the odds for death or MI for every 30 minutes of ischemia (95{\%} confidence interval 1.12 to 1.84, p = 0.004). Duration of ischemic events was related to their timing, such that ischemic events that occurred within the first 4 hours after PCI (median duration 141 minutes, interquartile range 36 to 227.5) were significantly longer than events occurring 4 to 24 hours after PCI (median duration 32.8 minutes, interquartile range 17.5 to 118, p = 0.041). In conclusion, early ischemia after PCI for NSTEACS is of longer duration, and longer duration of ischemia recognized by Holter monitoring is associated with an increased incidence of death or MI. Holter monitoring may be a useful surrogate end point in clinical trials. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Administration of fibrinolytic, antiplatelet, and antithrombotic agents by the intracoronary route may disaggregate clot, but the potential role of the mechanical force of the injection itself in decreasing clot burden has not been studied. Patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction who were pretreated in the emergency room (ER) with unfractionated heparin and aspirin in the TITAN-TIMI 34 study were randomized to treatment with eptifibatide in the ER (n = 131) versus after diagnostic catheterization (n = 150). Quantitative coronary angiography was used to assess change in diameter stenosis from time of first contrast injection to injection before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) immediately preceding wire placement down the culprit artery in a matching view. Successful perfusion of the myocardium was assessed after PCI by the presence of Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction myocardial perfusion grade of 2 or 3. In patients treated with eptifibatide in the ER, there was a 1.3{\%} absolute improvement in diameter stenosis from the first injection to the injection before PCI (p = 0.02), whereas there was no change in diameter stenosis in patients not treated with eptifibatide in the ER (0.0{\%}, p = NS). Each 1{\%} improvement in percent diameter stenosis during diagnostic injections before PCI was strongly correlated with an open muscle after PCI (adjusted odds ratio 1.09, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.02 to 1.16, p = 0.012). In conclusion, the mechanical force of a contrast injection decreases thrombotic burden in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction pretreated with eptifibatide but not with placebo. Future trials of intracoronary pharmacotherapies should include a control arm in which saline is injected to account for the potential clot disaggregation that occurs as a result of iodinated contrast injections, particularly if the patient has been pretreated with aggressive pharmacotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Rare mutations in the gene encoding for tau (MAPT, microtubule-associated protein tau) cause frontotemporal dementia-spectrum (FTD-s) disorders, including FTD, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal syndrome, and a common extended haplotype spanning across the MAPT locus is associated with increased risk of PSP and Parkinson's disease. We identified a rare tau variant (p.A152T) in a patient with a clinical diagnosis of PSP and assessed its frequency in multiple independent series of patients with neurodegenerative conditions and controls, in a total of 15 369 subjects. Tau p.A152T significantly increases the risk for both FTD-s (n = 2139, OR = 3.0, CI: 1.6-5.6, P = 0.0005) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 3345, OR = 2.3, CI: 1.3-4.2, P = 0.004) compared with 9047 controls. Functionally, p.A152T (i) decreases the binding of tau to microtubules and therefore promotes microtubule assembly less efficiently; and (ii) reduces the tendency to form abnormal fibers. However, there is a pronounced increase in the formation of tau oligomers. Importantly, these findings suggest that other regions of the tau protein may be crucial in regulating normal function, as the p.A152 residue is distal to the domains considered responsible for microtubule interactions or aggregation. These data provide both the first genetic evidence and functional studies supporting the role of MAPT p.A152T as a rare risk factor for both FTD-s and AD and the concept that rare variants can increase the risk for relatively common, complex neurodegenerative diseases, but since no clear significance threshold for rare genetic variation has been established, some caution is warranted until the findings are further replicated. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {Distal embolization of atherothrombotic material during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with impaired myocardial perfusion, abnormal left ventricular function, and higher mortality. At high local concentrations, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists have been demonstrated to promote clot disaggregation in vitro. Intracoronary administration of eptifibatide in vivo may increase local drug concentration by several orders of magnitude and promote clot disaggregation with a minimal increase in systemic drug concentrations. We hypothesized that intracoronary administration of eptifibatide before primary PCI for ST-elevation myocardial infarction would be safe and would be associated with high rates of normal myocardial perfusion. Clinical and angiographic data were pooled from patients who underwent primary PCI and received intracoronary eptifibatide as part of clinical practice. In-hospital adverse events were collected retrospectively. No deaths, urgent revascularizations, or reinfarctions were observed among the 59 patients who were treated with intracoronary eptifibatide. There were no Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) major bleeding events. Two TIMI minor bleeding events were noted. Normal TIMI myocardial perfusion grade 3 flow after PCI was noted in 54.4{\%} of patients. No adverse events. including arrhythmias, were noted during intracoronary eptifibatide administration. In conclusion, intracoronary eptifibatide can be administered safely during primary PCI and is associated with few adverse events. Relatively high rates of normal myocardial perfusion were observed after primary PCI with adjunctive intracoronary eptifibatide. Further prospective randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intracoronary eptifibatide. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {ROBO1 is a strong candidate gene for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) based upon its location under a linkage peak on chromosome 3p12, its expression pattern, and its purported function in a pathway that includes RORA, a gene previously associated with risk for neovascular AMD. Previously, we observed that expression of ROBO1 and RORA is down-regulated among wet AMD cases, as compared to their unaffected siblings. Thus, we hypothesized that contribution of association signals in ROBO1, and interaction between these two genes may be important for both wet and dry AMD. We evaluated association of 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ROBO1 with wet and dry stages of AMD in a sibling cohort and a Greek case-control cohort containing 491 wet AMD cases, 174 dry AMD cases and 411 controls. Association signals and interaction results were replicated in an independent prospective cohort (1070 controls, 164 wet AMD cases, 293 dry AMD cases). The most significantly associated ROBO1 SNPs were rs1387665 under an additive model (meta P = 0.028) for wet AMD and rs9309833 under a recessive model (meta P = 6×10 -4) for dry AMD. Further analyses revealed interaction between ROBO1 rs9309833 and RORA rs8034864 for both wet and dry AMD (interaction P{\textless}0.05). These studies were further supported by whole transcriptome expression profile studies from 66 human donor eyes and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays from mouse retinas. These findings suggest that distinct ROBO1 variants may influence the risk of wet and dry AMD, and the effects of ROBO1 on AMD risk may be modulated by RORA variants. {\textcopyright} 2011 Jun et al.},

abstract = {Objectives: The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the association of impaired Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG) with sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF). Background: Impaired TMPG after successful restoration of epicardial flow among patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes, but its relationship to VT/VF has not been evaluated. Methods: In the CLARITY-TIMI 28 (Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 28) study, 3,491 patients underwent angiography a median of 3.5 days after fibrinolytic administration for STEMI; TMPG was assessed, and its association with VT/VF was evaluated. Results: We observed VT/VF in 4.8{\%} of patients. Impaired myocardial perfusion (TMPG 0/1/2) was associated with an increased incidence of VT/VF (7.1{\%} vs. 2.6{\%} with TMPG 3; log-rank p {\textless} 0.001). Among patients with restoration of normal epicardial flow (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade 3), the incidence of VT/VF was increased among patients with impaired TMPG (4.7{\%} vs. 2.7{\%}; p = 0.02). Among patients with left ventricular ejection fraction ≥30{\%}, impaired TMPG remained associated with an increased incidence of VT/VF (4.7{\%} vs. 2.5{\%}; p = 0.03). We found that VT/VF was associated with increased mortality (25.2{\%} vs. 3.5{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001). Furthermore, among patients with VT/VF, impaired TMPG was associated with increased mortality (17.1{\%} vs. 2.3{\%}; p = 0.02). All but 1 death among patients who had VT/VF were among patients with impaired myocardial perfusion. Conclusions: Despite restoration of normal epicardial flow or a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥30{\%}, impaired myocardial perfusion on angiography 3.5 days after fibrinolytic administration for STEMI is associated with an increased incidence of VT/VF. {\textcopyright} 2008 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Objective: Large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many novel genes influencing Alzheimer disease (AD) risk, but most of the genetic variance remains unexplained. We conducted a 2-stage GWAS for AD-related quantitative measures of hippocampal volume (HV), total cerebral volume (TCV), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Methods: Brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of HV, TCV, and WMH were obtained from 981 Caucasian and 419 African American AD cases and their cognitively normal siblings in the MIRAGE (Multi Institutional Research in Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology) Study, and from 168 AD cases, 336 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 188 controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Study. A GWAS for each trait was conducted in the 2 Caucasian data sets in stage 1. Results from the 2 data sets were combined by meta-analysis. In stage 2, 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from each region that was nominally significant in each data set (p {\textless} 0.05) and strongly associated in both data sets (p {\textless} 1.0 × 10 -5) was evaluated in the African American data set. Results: Twenty-two markers (14 for HV, 3 for TCV, and 5 for WMH) from distinct regions met criteria for evaluation in stage 2. Novel genome-wide significant associations (p {\textless} 5.0 × 10 -8) were attained for HV with SNPs in the APOE, F5/SELP, LHFP, and GCFC2 gene regions. All of these associations were supported by evidence in each data set. Associations with different SNPs in the same gene (p {\textless} 1 × 10 -5 in Caucasians and p {\textless} 2.2 × 10 -4 in African Americans) were also observed for PICALM with HV, SYNPR with TCV, and TTC27 with WMH. Interpretation: Our study demonstrates the efficacy of endophenotypes for broadening our understanding of the genetic basis of AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Neurological Association.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the association of risk and age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer disease (AD) with single-ucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 19 region including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and a repeatlength polymorphism in TOMM40 (poly-T, rs10524523). Design: Conditional logistic regression models and survival analysis. Setting : Fifteen genome-wide association study data sets assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Participants: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty AD cases and 10 931 cognitively normal elderly controls. Main Outcome Measures: Association of AD risk and AAO with genotyped and imputed SNPs located in an 800-Mb region including APOE in the entire Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set and with the TOMM40 poly-T marker genotyped in a subset of 1256 cases and 1605 controls. Results: In models adjusting for APOE $\epsilon$4, no SNPs in the entire region were significantly associated with AAO at P {\textless} .001. Rs10524523 was not significantly associated with AD or AAO in models adjusting for APOE genotype or within the subset of $\epsilon$3/$\epsilon$3 subjects. Conclusions: APOE alleles $\epsilon$2, $\epsilon$3, and $\epsilon$4 account for essentially all the inherited risk of AD associated with this region. Other variants including a poly-T track in TOMM40 are not independent risk or AAO loci. {\textcopyright}2012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Background: Outcomes in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) differ between those in clinical trials and those in routine practice, as well as across different regions. We hypothesized that adjustment for baseline risk would minimize such variations. Methods: The Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 registry was an observational study of patients with STEMI presenting to hospitals participating in the ExTRACT-TIMI 25 randomized clinical trial. Consecutive patients with STEMI who were not enrolled in the trial were entered into the registry. Demographics, in-hospital therapies, and in-hospital events were collected. Baseline risk was assessed using the TIMI Risk Index for STEMI. To adjust for differences among the countries from which the patients presented, the gross national income per annum per capita (GNI) was used. Results: A total of 3726 patients were registered from 109 sites in 25 countries. Patients in the registry had a higher baseline risk than those in the trial; they had more extensive prior cardiac histories and more comorbidities. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality was higher in the registry (8.3{\%}) than in the trial (6.6{\%}) (hazard ratio, 1.30; P {\textless} .001); however, after adjusting for TIMI Risk Index, mortality was similar (hazard ratioadj, 1.00; P = .97). The GNI was not significantly predictive of in-hospital mortality in the multivariable model of the registry. Conclusion: Patients in the registry had higher mortality than those in the trial. This difference could be explained by the higher baseline risk of patients in the registry. After adjusting for baseline risk, the GNI of the country in which the patient presented did not contribute to predicting in-hospital mortality. {\textcopyright} 2007 Mosby, Inc.

abstract = {In patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), the restoration of normal epicardial flow following fibrinolytic administration is associated with improved clinical outcomes. The goal of this analysis was to examine the relation between hyperemic flow and outcomes following fibrinolytic administration for STEMI. In Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 28 (CLARITY-TIMI 28), patients with STEMI (n = 3,491) treated with fibrinolytic therapy were scheduled to undergo angiography 48 to 192 hours after randomization. Corrected TIMI frame count (CTFC) and TIMI myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG) were assessed, and their associations with outcomes at 30 days were evaluated. When evaluating initial angiography of the infarct-related artery, there was a nearly linear relation between CTFC and 30-day mortality, with faster flow (lower CTFC) associated with improved outcomes. Conversely, in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), very fast flow (CTFC {\textless}14) after intervention was associated with worse outcomes. Post-PCI hyperemic flow (CTFC {\textless}14) was associated with a higher incidence of mortality (p = 0.056), recurrent myocardial infarction (p = 0.011), and a composite of death or myocardial infarction (p {\textless}0.001) compared with normal flow (CTFC 14 to 28). When post-PCI CTFC was further stratified by TMPG, there was a U-shaped relation between mortality and CTFC in patients with poor myocardial perfusion (TMPG 0 or 1). This relation appeared to be linear in patients with TMPG 2 or 3. In conclusion, in patients who undergo PCI after fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI, hyperemic flow on coronary angiography is associated with an increased incidence of adverse outcomes. Hyperemic flow with associated impaired myocardial perfusion may be a marker of more extensive downstream microembolization. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Increased thickness of the left ventricular (LV) wall is the predominant feature of the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) phenotype. The structural characteristics of the LV papillary muscles (PMs) have received little attention. In this study, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) was used to characterize PM morphology in a large HC population. Cine and delayed enhancement (DE) CMR images were obtained in 201 patients with HC and 43 control subjects. PM number and mass index were greater in patients with HC compared with controls (2.5 vs 2.1, p {\textless}0.001, and 6 ± 2 vs 3 ± 2 g/m                        2, p {\textless}0.001, respectively), including 109 (54{\%}) with PM mass ≥7 g/m                        2 (≥2 SDs above the mean for controls). Greater LV wall mass index was associated with more substantial PM mass (r = 0.09, p {\textless}0.001). Furthermore, 12 patients with HC (19{\%}) had normal LV mass with localized wall thickness but increased PM mass. In patients with HC with LV outflow obstruction at rest, PMs were positioned closer to the ventricular septum (displaced anteriorly: 58{\%} vs 42{\%} for subjects without obstruction, p = 0.02), with more marked hypertrophy (9 ± 5 vs 6 ± 4 g/m                        2, p {\textless}0.001). Preoperative CMR identified 3 patients with accessory, anteriorly displaced PMs judged to contribute to outflow obstruction, which were resected during septal myectomy. DE of the PMs was identified in 13 patients with HC (6{\%}), including 3 with DE confined to PMs. In conclusion, CMR demonstrates LV PMs to be part of the cardiomyopathic process in HC, with increases in number and mass, and not uncommonly associated with remodeling with DE. The identification of accessory PMs may be useful in planning preoperative strategy. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND - Heart-type fatty acid binding protein (H-FABP) is a cytosolic protein that is released rapidly from the cardiomyocyte in response to myocardial injury. Although it has been investigated as an early marker of acute myocardial infarction, its prognostic utility in acute coronary syndromes has not been established. METHODS AND RESULTS - We measured H-FABP in 2287 patients with acute coronary syndromes from the OPUS-TIMI 16 trial. H-FABP was elevated ({\textgreater}8 ng/mL) in 332 patients (14.5{\%}). Patients with an elevated H-FABP were more likely to suffer death (hazard ratio [HR], 4.1; 95{\%} CI, 2.6 to 6.5), recurrent myocardial infarction (HR, 1.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.0 to 2.5), congestive heart failure (HR, 4.5; 95{\%} CI, 2.6 to 7.8), or the composite of these end points (HR, 2.6; 95{\%} CI, 1.9 to 3.5) through the 10-month follow-up period. H-FABP predicted the risk of the composite end point both in patients who were troponin I negative (HR, 2.1; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 3.4) and in those who were troponin I positive (HR, 3.3; 95{\%} CI, 2.0 to 5.3). In a Cox proportional-hazards model that adjusted for baseline variables, including demographics, clinical characteristics, creatinine clearance, ST deviation, index diagnosis, and troponin I, elevated H-FABP remained a significant predictor of the composite end point (HR, 1.9; 95{\%} CI, 1.3 to 2.7), as well as the individual end points of death (HR, 2.7; 95{\%} CI, 1.5 to 4.9) and CHF (HR, 2.4; 95{\%} CI, 1.2 to 5.0). In a multimarker approach, H-FABP, troponin I, and B-type natriuretic peptide provided complementary information. CONCLUSIONS - Elevation of H-FABP is associated with an increased risk of death and major cardiac events in patients presenting across the spectrum of acute coronary syndromes and is independent of other established clinical risk predictors and biomarkers. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Heart Association, Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance with delayed enhancement (DE) can provide in vivo assessment of myocardial fibrosis. However, the clinical significance of DE in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) remains unresolved. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cine and cardiovascular magnetic resonance with DE were performed in 202 HCM patients (mean age, 42+/-17 years; 71{\%} male), DE was compared with clinical and demographic variables, and patients were followed up for 681+/-249 days for adverse disease events. DE was identified in 111 (55{\%}) HCM patients, occupying 9{\%}+/-11{\%} of left ventricular myocardial volume, including {\textgreater}25{\%} DE in 10{\%} of patients. The presence of DE was related to occurrence of heart failure symptoms (P=0.05) and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (P=0.001). DE was present in all patients with ejection fraction {\textless} or =50{\%} but also in 53{\%} (102/192) of patients with preserved ejection fraction (P{\textless}0.001); {\%}DE was both inversely related to (r=-0.3; P{\textless}0.001) and an independent predictor of ejection fraction (r=-0.4; P{\textless}0.001). DE (7{\%}+/-7{\%} of left ventricle) was present in 54 patients who were asymptomatic (and with normal ejection fraction). Over the follow-up period, the annualized adverse cardiovascular event rate in patients with DE exceeded that in patients without DE but did not achieve statistical significance (5.5{\%} versus 3.3{\%}; P=0.5). CONCLUSIONS: In a large HCM cohort, DE was an independent predictor of systolic dysfunction but with only a modest relationship to heart failure symptoms. These data suggest an important role for myocardial fibrosis in the clinical course of HCM patients but are not sufficient at this time to consider DE as an independent risk factor for adverse prognosis.},

abstract = {Background: Prasugrel led to a significant reduction in ischemic cardiovascular events among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation compared to clopidogrel. Whether this benefit extends to patients undergoing PCI without stent implantation is unknown. Methods: In TRial to assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by optimizing platelet inhibitioN with prasugrel (TRITON)-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) 38, patients (n = 13 608) undergoing PCI for ACS were randomized to aspirin plus clopidogrel or prasugrel. This postrandomization analysis of a prespecified subgroup was restricted to patients who underwent PCI without stent implantation (n = 569). Results: Patients who underwent PCI without stent implantation were older and had a higher incidence of hypertension, diabetes, prior myocardial infarction (MI), prior coronary artery bypass (CABG) surgery, and renal dysfunction than patients who underwent stent implantation. In the group that did not undergo stent implantation, baseline characteristics were similar between patients receiving clopidogrel and prasugrel. The composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, and nonfatal stroke occurred in 14.2{\%} of patients receiving prasugrel and 17.1{\%} of patients receiving clopidogrel (HR 0.82, P = .27). There were significant reductions favoring prasugrel in the rates of urgent target vessel revascularization (TVR; HR 0.46, P = .040) and any TVR (HR 0.40, P = .009) and a trend toward a reduction in the incidence of nonfatal MI (HR 0.65, P = .11). CABG-related TIMI major bleeding was more frequent among patients receiving prasugrel. There were no significant interactions between treatment and PCI type. Conclusion: Among ACS patients who underwent PCI without stent implantation, prasugrel therapy tended to reduce clinical ischemic events and to increase bleeding events to a similar magnitude as among patients who received stents. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

abstract = {Background: Using a transcriptional profiling approach, we recently identified myeloid-related protein 8/14 (MRP-8/14) to be expressed by platelets during acute myocardial infarction (MI). Elevated concentrations of MRP-8/14 are associated with a higher risk for future cardiovascular events in apparently healthy individuals but have not been assessed with respect to prognosis in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Methods: We performed a nested case-control study (n = 237 case-control pairs) among patients enrolled in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Theraphy: Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial (mean follow-up 24 months) to investigate the risk of cardiovascular death or MI associated with MRP-8/14 measured at 30 days after an acute coronary syndrome. Results: Patients with cardiovascular death or MI after 30 days (cases) had higher median [25th, 75th percentile] MRP-8/14 levels than patients who remained free of recurrent events (5.6 [2.8, 13.5] mg/L vs 4.0 [1.9, 10.1] mg/L, P = .020). The risk of a recurrent cardiovascular event increased with each increasing quartile of MRP-8/14 (P-trend = 0.007) such that patients with the highest levels had a 2.0-fold increased odds (95{\%} CI 1.1-3.6, P = .029) of a recurrent event after adjusting for standard risk indicators, randomized treatment, and C-reactive protein. Patients with elevated levels of MRP-8/14 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein showed significantly increased risk of cardiovascular death or MI compared with patients with the lowest levels of both markers (adjusted odds ratio 2.1, 95{\%} CI 1.2-3.8). Conclusions: Myeloid-related protein 8/14 may be a useful biomarker of platelet and inflammatory disease activity in atherothrombosis and may serve as a novel target for therapeutic intervention. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

Background: Myocardial fibrosis is identified frequently in HCM; however, the clinical significance of this finding is uncertain. Methods: We studied prevalence and frequency of tachyarrhythmias on 24-h ambulatory Holter electrocardiogram (ECG) with regard to delayed enhancement (DE) on contrast-enhanced CMR in 177 HCM patients (age 41 ± 16 yrs; 95{\%} asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic). Results: Premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), couplets, and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) were more common in patients with DE than those without DE (PVCs: 89{\%} vs. 72{\%}; couplets: 40{\%} vs. 17{\%}; NSVT: 28{\%} vs. 4{\%}; p {\textless} 0.0001 to 0.007).

Conclusions: In this large HCM cohort with no or only mild symptoms, myocardial fibrosis detected by CMR was associated with greater likelihood and increased frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias (including NSVT) on ambulatory Holter ECG.

Background: Ranolazine is an antianginal shown to reduce angina and improve exercise performance in selected patients with early-positive exercise testing and those with frequent angina. Methods: We investigated the antianginal effects of ranolazine in the subgroup of patients with prior chronic angina (n = 3,565, 54{\%}) enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled MERLIN-TIMI (Metabolic Efficiency With Ranolazine for Less Ischemia in Non-ST Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes) 36 trial of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Follow-up was a median of 350 days. Results: Patients with prior angina received evidence-based therapy (95{\%} aspirin, 78{\%} statins, 89{\%} beta-blockers, average 2.9 antianginal agents). The primary end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, recurrent ischemia) was less frequent with ranolazine (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.86; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI]: 0.75 to 0.97; p = 0.017), due entirely to a significant reduction in recurrent ischemia (HR: 0.78; 95{\%} CI: 0.67 to 0.91; p = 0.002). Ranolazine also reduced worsening angina (HR: 0.77; 95{\%} CI: 0.59 to 1.00; p = 0.048) and intensification of antianginal therapy (HR: 0.77; 95{\%} CI: 0.64 to 0.92, p = 0.005). Exercise duration at 8 months was greater with ranolazine (514 s vs. 482 s, p = 0.002). Cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction did not differ between treatment groups (HR: 0.97; 95{\%} CI: 0.80 to 1.16; p = 0.71). Symptomatic documented arrhythmias (2.9{\%} vs. 2.9{\%}, p = 0.92) and total mortality (6.2{\%} vs. 6.4{\%}, p = 0.96) were similar with ranolazine or placebo.

abstract = {The clinical relevance of periprocedural myocardial injury related to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) remains controversial. N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) is a sensitive indicator of hemodynamic stress and when increased is associated with higher mortality in patients with acute and chronic ischemic heart disease. We measured the serum level of NT-pro-BNP using the Elecsys 2010 proBNP assay at baseline, 4 to 6 hours, and 12 to 24 hours in 747 patients undergoing elective or urgent PCI and enrolled in the JUMBO-TIMI 26 trial. Periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) was independently adjudicated and required a new increase in creatine kinase-MB {\textgreater}3 times the upper limit of normal distinct from MI as the indication for PCI. Patients with procedural MI had significantly higher levels of NT-pro-BNP at 12 to 24 hours (405 vs 146 pg/ml, p {\textless}0.001). Moreover, the greater increase in NT-pro-BNP in patients with periprocedural MI was independent of each clinical and other procedural correlates of NT-pro-BNP after PCI (p {\textless}0.001). In addition, the magnitude of increase in NT-pro-BNP correlated strongly with extent of myocardial injury, including in patients with evidence of injury (creatine kinase-MB 1 to 3 times upper limit of normal) not meeting criteria for MI (p = 0.001) or low-level increase in troponin T (p = 0.001). In conclusion, periprocedural myocardial injury, even at low levels, during PCI is associated with increased hemodynamic stress as measured by increasing NT-pro-BNP. This finding supports the physiologic relevance of procedural MI and the continued effort to define therapies that decrease the risk of this complication. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Background: Use of saphenous vein graft (SVG) radiographic markers has been associated with shorter cardiac catheterization procedure times and reduced contrast agent volume for postoperative coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) catheterizations. Use of such markers is varied and often operator-dependent, as the effect of SVG markers has not been fully evaluated. The goal of the present analysis was to evaluate the association of SVG markers with clinical outcomes and graft patency. Methods: Data were drawn from the Project of Ex-vivo Vein Graft Engineering via Transfection (PREVENT) IV trial of patients undergoing CABG at 107 hospitals across the United States. Repeat angiography was performed within 12 to 18 months after CABG. The SVG markers were used at the discretion of the surgeon and were identified on the follow-up angiogram as any device used to mark the ostium, regardless of shape. Results: The SVG markers were present in 51.2{\%} of evaluable patients (910 of 1,778) and 52.3{\%} of SVGs (2,228 of 4,240). Among patients with totally occluded SVGs (n = 911), visual identification of the SVG was obtained more frequently in those with an SVG marker (90.7{\%} vs 72.1{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). The SVG stenosis 70{\%} or greater at follow-up did not differ by use of markers (25.8{\%} with marker vs 24.4{\%} without marker, p = not significant). These findings were also consistent in ostial lesions (n = 942). Long-term death or myocardial infarction (MI) was similar by use of marker. The perioperative CABG MI was higher in patients with SVG markers (10.1{\%} vs 5.5{\%}, odds ratio adjusted 1.86, p = 0.021). Conclusions: Saphenous vein graft radiographic markers were associated with higher rates of direct visualization of totally occluded SVGs without an adverse effect on graft patency or long-term clinical outcomes, but the association of SVG markers with increased perioperative CABG MI warrants further examination. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.},

abstract = {Background: Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) represent a high-risk patient subset in the setting of non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes (NSTE ACS). The efficacy and safety of early invasive management for such patients remains unclear. Hypothesis: Early invasive management would be well tolerated and effective among patients with NSTE ACS and PAD. Methods: Patients from the Treat angina with Aggrastat and determine Cost of Therapy with an Invasive or Conservative Strategy - Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TACTICS-TIMI) 18 trial were stratified by the presence or absence of PAD and assessed with respect to baseline clinical factors. The outcomes of patients with PAD and NSTE ACS were examined with respect to treatment assignment to either early invasive therapy or conservative treatment of NSTE ACS. Finally, the bleeding and stroke rates of patients with PAD managed invasively were compared with patients with PAD managed conservatively. Results: Of 2,219 patients with NSTE ACS overall, 166 (7.5{\%}) had concomitant PAD. Compared with those patients without PAD, those with PAD were older (75 vs. 62 years, p {\textless} 0.001) and were more likely to have high-risk clinical features, including prior histories of bypass surgery (39 vs. 20{\%}, p {\textless}0.001) or diabetes mellitus (38 vs. 27{\%}, p = 0.002), and more ST-segment depression on their 12-lead electrocardiogram (43 vs. 29{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001). Among such patients, early invasive management was associated with significant reductions in the risk of myocardial infarction (MI) at 30 days (11.4 vs. 2.3{\%}, p = 0.03). At 180 days, compared with early conservative management, early invasive treatment for patients with PAD and NSTE ACS was associated with similar reductions in MI (12.7 vs. 3.5{\%}, p = 0.04), and was also accompanied by significant reductions in risk of death (10.1 vs. 2.3{\%}, p = 0.05). No excess in bleeding or stroke rates was noted among patients with PAD managed invasively. Conclusions: Among patients with NSTE ACS and a history of PAD, early invasive management is well tolerated and accompanied by significant reductions in morbidity and mortality when compared with a more conservative, ischemia-driven approach.},

abstract = {Objectives: To determine whether genotypes at CLU, PICALM, and CR1 confer risk for Alzheimer disease (AD) and whether risk for AD associated with these genes is influenced by apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes. Design: Association study ofADand CLU, PICALM, CR1, and APOE genotypes. Setting: Academic research institutions in the United States, Canada, and Israel. Participants: Seven thousand seventy cases with AD, 3055 with autopsies, and 8169 elderly cognitively normal controls, 1092 with autopsies, from 12 different studies, including white, African American, Israeli-Arab, and Caribbean Hispanic individuals. Results: Unadjusted, CLU (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96 for single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs11136000), CR1 (OR, 1.14; 95{\%} CI, 1.07-1.22; SNP rs3818361), and PICALM (OR, 0.89; 95{\%} CI, 0.84-0.94, SNP rs3851179) were associated with AD in white individuals. None were significantly associated with AD in the other ethnic groups. APOE$\epsilon$4 was significantly associated with AD (ORs, 1.80-9.05) in all but 1 small white cohort and in the Arab cohort. Adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least 1 APOE$\epsilon$4 allele greatly reduced evidence for association with PICALM but not CR1 or CLU. Models with the main SNP effect, presence or absence of APOE$\epsilon$4, and an interaction term showed significant interaction between presence or absence of APOE$\epsilon$4 and PICALM. Conclusions: We confirm in a completely independent data set that CR1, CLU, and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in European ancestry populations. Genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly in APOE $\epsilon$4-positive subjects. Thus, APOE and PICALM synergistically interact. {\textcopyright}2010 American Medical Association.

Methods and results: The principal analysis was conducted in 2200 patients in OPUS-TIMI 16 with C-reactive protein data available and then validated in the invasive arm of TACTICS-TIMI 18 (n = 929). In addition, two further inflammatory markers [monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and von Willebrand factor (vWF)] were assessed in OPUS-TIMI 16. Diabetic patients had higher C-reactive protein and MCP-1 levels vs. non-diabetic patients in OPUS-TIMI 16 (9 vs. 7.8 mg/L, P = 0.002, and 190.6 vs. 170.8 pg/mL, P = 0.04, respectively), higher C-reactive protein levels in TACTICS-TIMI 18 (6.6 vs. 5.2 mg/L, P = 0.0005), and as expected higher glucose levels in both trials. Stratifying by the median C-reactive protein and diabetes in OPUS-TIMI 16, diabetic patients with C-reactive protein greater than or equal to the median were the highest risk group vs. non-diabetic patients with C-reactive protein less than the median (adjusted HR 1.63, 95{\%} CI 1.20-2.23, P = 0.002). Directionally, similar findings were observed for MCP-1 and vWF in OPUS-TIMI 16 and for C-reactive protein in TACTICS-TIMI 18. After adjustment for diabetes, the risk associated with a 1 mmol/L increase in glucose was greater among those with a C-reactive protein greater than or equal to the median (HR 1.07, 95{\%} CI 1.03-1.11) vs. those with a C-reactive protein less than the median (HR 1.02, 95{\%} CI 0.97-1.06). After multivariable adjustment, the synergistic relationship between glucose and C-reactive protein and clinical outcomes remained statistically significant (P = 0.01). A similar pattern was observed in TACTICS-TIMI 18. Conclusion: Among ACS patients, diabetes was associated with both greater inflammation and higher glucose levels and patients with both hyperglycaemia and inflammation had worse outcomes. Better control of both inflammation and hyperglycaemia should be assessed in future ACS trials as a means to reduce the cardiovascular risk among diabetics. {\textcopyright} The European Society of Cardiology 2007.

In STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy and scheduled for angiography later during hospital admission, however, the association of later indices of flow and perfusion with clinical outcomes has not been assessed. Methods: Clopidogrel as Adjunctive Reperfusion Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (CLARITY-TIMI) 28 enrolled 3,491 STEMI patients treated with fibrinolytic therapy.

We hypothesized that treatment with NSAIDs prior to an index MI would be associated with an increase in the risk of death, heart failure and recurrent MI among patients with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) treated with fibrinolytic therapy. Methods: In ExTRACT-TIMI 25, patients with STEMI were treated with aspirin and fibrinolytic therapy and randomized to either enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin. We included patients who had received NSAIDs within 7 days of enrollment and evaluated the incidence of MI, the composite of death and MI and the composite of death, MI, severe heart failure and shock through 30 days. Results: Of 20,479 patients enrolled, 572 (2.8{\%}) received an NSAID within 7 days of enrollment. NSAID treatment prior to entry was associated with a higher incidence of 30-day death or nonfatal recurrent MI (15.9{\%} vs. 10.8{\%}, univariate P {\textless} 0.001). In multivariable models adjusting for randomization group and differences in baseline characteristics, NSAID use was associated with higher odds of MI (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] 1.44, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.07, P = 0.047), the composite of death and MI (ORadj 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.00-1.66, P = 0.051), and the composite of death, MI, severe heart failure and shock (ORadj 1.29, 95{\%} CI 1.02-1.65, P = 0.037). Conclusions: Among STEMI patients treated with a fibrinolytic agent and aspirin, use of NSAIDs in the week preceding the incident event was associated with a higher incidence of MI, the composite of death and MI as well as the composite of death, MI, severe heart failure and shock at 30 days. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.},

abstract = {Platelet activation and aggregation play pivotal roles in the thrombotic process of acute coronary syndromes. However, data regarding platelet count and its association with clinical outcomes in the setting of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are limited. We hypothesized that higher platelet counts on presentation would be associated with poorer clinical outcomes. Data from 10,793 patients with STEMI in the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) trials database were analyzed. Mean platelet count on presentation was 254.8 × 103/$\mu$l. Higher platelet counts were associated with higher rates of adverse clinical outcomes at 30 days. In a multivariable analysis that adjusted for confounders of platelet counts (age, gender, weight, diabetes, and smoking), higher platelet counts remained associated with an increased risk of the combined end point of death, reinfarction, and congestive heart failure. With a reference group of platelet counts {\textless}200 × 103/$\mu$l, the multivariable odds ratios were 1.22 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.05 to 1.42, p = 0.009) for platelet counts of 201 to 300 × 103/$\mu$l, 1.37 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.11 to 1.68, p = 0.002) for counts of 301 to 400 × 103/$\mu$l, and 1.71 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.16 to 2.51, p = 0.005) for counts {\textgreater}400 × 103/$\mu$l. Further, a greater decrease in follow-up platelet counts (compared with baseline values) was independently associated with an increased risk of reinfarction at 30 days (odds ratio 1.44 for every decrease of 100 × 103/$\mu$l unit of platelets, 95{\%} confidence interval 1.13 to 1.82, p = 0.03).

abstract = {Silent ischemia, the most common expression of atherosclerotic heart disease, affects approximately 30-50{\%} of patients during their activities of daily living. The present review provides a comprehensive and practical summary of current knowledge on perioperative myocardial ischemia through MEDLINE searches up to June 2005, using keywords including "silent ischemia," "transient ischemia," and "Holter monitoring." Holter monitoring (i.e., continuous ambulatory ST-segment monitoring) is an effective tool for assessing the frequency and duration of silent transient myocardial ischemia, particularly in patients who are post-acute myocardial infarction (MI), those with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), and in patients in the acute post-operative period. Holter monitoring allows for further risk stratification of patients who have a positive exercise ECG by collecting long-term ECG data on ischemic and arrhythmic events while patients perform routine activities. Both the presence and increased duration of transient ischemia as detected by continuous ST-segment Holter monitoring are associated with increased rates of coronary events and mortality. Holter monitoring may aid in the identification of patients and subgroups of patients with ACS who may derive the greatest benefit from antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy. Indeed, many ongoing and upcoming trials of pharmacotherapy include ischemia on Holter monitoring as an endpoint. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

abstract = {Previous studies have demonstrated an association between increased baseline platelet counts and poorer clinical and angiographic outcomes in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). We hypothesized that antiplatelet therapy would mitigate the effect of high baseline platelet counts on clinical outcomes. Data were obtained from 3,491 patients with STEMI in the CLARITY-TIMI 28 trial. Patients were categorized into 3 groups based on their baseline platelet counts: {\textless}200 × 10                        3/$\mu$l (group 1), 200 to 300 × 10                        3/$\mu$l (group 2), and {\textgreater}300 × 10                        3/$\mu$l (group 3). Among placebo-treated patients, reinfarction rates increased in a stepwise fashion as platelet counts increased (3.6{\%}, 5.4{\%}, and 9.0{\%}, respectively, p for trend = 0.0025). When confounders of high platelet counts and correlates of reinfarction were adjusted for in a multivariate model, high platelet counts remained independently associated with increased rates of reinfarction at 30 days in placebo-treated patients; using group 1 as a reference group, multivariate odds ratios were 1.45 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.91 to 2.31, p = 0.119) for patients in group 2 and 1.78 (95{\%} confidence interval 1.03 to 3.08, p = 0.038) for patients in group 3. In contrast, among clopidogrel-treated patients, there was no increase in the risk of reinfarction as the platelet count increased (3.2{\%}, 4.1{\%}, and 3.3{\%}, respectively; p for trend = 0.9073, p for interaction = 0.064). In conclusion, among patients with STEMI who are treated with aspirin and a fibrinolytic agent, high platelet counts on presentation are independently associated with increased rates of reinfarction. Clopidogrel therapy abolishes this increase in the risk of reinfarction as platelet counts increase. These data are consistent with a putative role of platelets in reinfarction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Likewise, the interaction between CFR and the thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) myocardial perfusion grade (TMPG) is unknown. CFR was measured using the number of cineframes required for the contrast to traverse the same length of the coronary artery before and following the administration of intracoronary adenosine. Following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), CFR was assessed both proximal and distal to the lesion in 192 consecutive patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) from the PROTECT TIMI-30 trial. TMPG was also assessed. The difference between the distal and proximal CFR for patients with TMPG 0/1 (n = 76) was 0.11 (95{\%} CI 0.01-0.20, P = 0.026), while among those with TMPG 2/3 (n = 114) it was -0.02 (95{\%} CI -0.09-0.06, P = 0.65). The difference in the CFR between the distal and proximal segments among patients with TMPG 0/1 and TMPG 2/3 was significant (P interaction = 0.044). Following PCI among patients with impaired TMPG (0/1) in the setting of NSTEACS, CFR varies significantly between the proximal and distal segment of coronary arteries and is associated with higher (greater) distal CFR. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2011.},

abstract = {In addition to apolipoprotein E (APOE), recent large genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified nine other genes/loci (CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, MS4A4/MS4A6E, CD2AP, CD33, EPHA1 and ABCA7) for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). However, the genetic effect attributable to known loci is about 50{\%}, indicating that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified. In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938 controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1{\%} GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P {\textless} 0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci. The new GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at ∼2.5 million markers. As expected, several markers in the APOE regions showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample. While we observed nominal significant associations (P0.05) either within or adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), significant signals were observed 69-180 kb outside of the remaining four genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1). Meta-analysis on the top 1{\%} SNPs revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP rs3848140 with P=3.05E-07). The association of this SNP with AD risk was consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43. This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the brain and is involved in lipid metabolism. These findings need to be confirmed in additional samples. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence suggest that specific subtypes of age-related cataract (ARC) and Alzheimer disease (AD) are related etiologically. To identify shared genetic factors for ARC and AD, we estimated co-heritability of quantitative measures of cataract subtypes with AD-related brain MRI traits among 1,249 members of the Framingham Eye Study who had a brain MRI scan approximately ten years after the eye exam. Cortical cataract (CC) was found to be co-heritable with future development of AD and with several MRI traits, especially temporal horn volume (THV, $\rho$ = 0.24, P{\textless}10-4). A genome-wide association study using 187,657 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the bivariate outcome of CC and THV identified genome-wide significant association with CTNND2 SNPs rs17183619, rs13155993 and rs13170756 (P{\textless}2.6×10-7). These SNPs were also significantly associated with bivariate outcomes of CC and scores on several highly heritable neuropsychological tests (5.7×10-9≤P{\textless}3.7×10-6). Statistical interaction was demonstrated between rs17183619 and APP SNP rs2096488 on CC (P = 0.0015) and CC-THV (P = 0.038). A rare CTNND2 missense mutation (G810R) 249 base pairs from rs17183619 altered $\delta$-catenin localization and increased secreted amyloid-$\beta$1-42 in neuronal cell culture. Immunohistopathological analysis of lens tissue obtained from two autopsy-confirmed AD subjects and two non-AD controls revealed elevated expression of $\delta$-catenin in epithelial and cortical regions of lenses from AD subjects compared to controls. Our findings suggest that genetic variation in delta catenin may underlie both cortical lens opacities in mid-life and subsequent MRI and cognitive changes that presage the development of AD. {\textcopyright} 2012 Jun et al.},

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the association of genetic variation with late-onset Alzheimer disease (AD) in African Americans, including genes implicated in recent genome-wide association studies of whites. Design: We analyzed a genome-wide set of 2.5 million imputed markers to evaluate the genetic basis of AD in an African American population. Subjects: Five hundred thirteen well-characterized African American AD cases and 496 cognitively normal African American control subjects. Setting: Data were collected from multiple sites as part of the Multi-Institutional Research on Alzheimer Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) Study and the Henry Ford Health System as part of the Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors for Alzheimer Disease Among African Americans (GenerAAtions) Study. Results: Several significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were observed in the region of the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). After adjusting for the confounding effects of APOE genotype, one of these SNPs, rs6859 in PVRL2, remained significantly associated with AD (P=.0087). Association was also observed with SNPs in CLU, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A, ABCA7, and CD33, although the effect direction for some SNPs and the most significant SNPs differed from findings in data sets consisting of whites. Finally, using the African American genome-wide association study data set as a discovery sample, we obtained suggestive evidence of association with SNPs for several novel candidate genes. Conclusions: Some genes contribute to AD pathogenesis in both white and African American cohorts, although it is unclear whether the causal variants are the same. A larger African American sample will be needed to confirm novel gene associations, which may be population specific. {\textcopyright}2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Objectives: Our purpose was to characterize the pattern and distribution of left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy by cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) to more precisely define phenotypic expression and its clinical implications in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Background: Based on prior pathologic and 2-dimensional echocardiographic studies, HCM has been regarded as a disease characterized by substantial LV wall thickening. Methods: Cine and late gadolinium enhancement CMR were performed in 333 consecutive HCM patients (age 43 ± 17 years). Results: Basal anterior LV free wall and the contiguous anterior ventricular septum were the most commonly hypertrophied segments (n = 256; 77{\%}). LV hypertrophy was focal (involving ≤2 segments [≤12{\%} of LV]) in 41 patients (12{\%}), intermediate (3 to 7 segments [13{\%} to 49{\%} of LV]) in 112 patients (34{\%}), and diffuse (≥8 segments [≥50{\%} of LV]) in 180 patients (54{\%}); 42 patients (13{\%}) showed hypertrophied segments separated by regions of normal thickness. The number of hypertrophied segments was greater in patients with LV outflow tract obstruction (≥30 mm Hg) than without (10 ± 4 vs. 8 ± 4 per patient; p = 0.0001) and was associated with an advanced New York Heart Association functional class (p = 0.007). LV wall thickness was greater in segments with late gadolinium enhancement than without (20 ± 6 mm vs. 16 ± 6 mm; p {\textless} 0.001). We also identified 40 (12{\%}) of HCM patients with segmental LV hypertrophy largely confined to the anterolateral free wall, posterior septum, or apex, which was underestimated or undetected by echocardiography. Conclusions: Although diverse, patterns of LV hypertrophy are usually not extensive in HCM, involving ≤50{\%} of the chamber in about one-half the patients, and are particularly limited in extent in an important minority. Contiguous portions of anterior free wall and septum constituted the predominant region of wall thickening, with implications for clinical diagnosis. These observations support an emerging role for CMR in the contemporary evaluation of patients with HCM. {\textcopyright} 2009 American College of Cardiology Foundation.},

abstract = {Joint modelling of longitudinal and time-to-event data has received much attention recently. Increasingly, extensions to standard joint modelling approaches are being proposed to handle complex data structures commonly encountered in applied research. In this paper we propose a joint model for hierarchical longitudinal and time-to-event data. Our motivating application explores the association between tumor burden and progression-free survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. We define tumor burden as a function of the sizes of target lesions clustered within a patient. Since a patient may have more than one lesion, and each lesion is tracked over time, the data have a three-level hierarchical structure: repeated measurements taken at time points (level 1) clustered within lesions (level 2) within patients (level 3). We jointly model the lesion-specific longitudinal trajectories and patient-specific risk of death or disease progression by specifying novel association structures that combine information across lower level clusters (e.g. lesions) into patient-level summaries (e.g. tumor burden). We provide user-friendly software for fitting the model under a Bayesian framework. Lastly, we discuss alternative situations in which additional clustering factor(s) occur at a level higher in the hierarchy than the patient-level, since this has implications for the model formulation.},

abstract = {Patients with highly mutated tumors, such as melanoma or smoking-related lung cancer, have higher rates of response to immune checkpoint blockade therapy, perhaps due to increased neoantigen expression. Many chemotherapies including platinum compounds are known to be mutagenic, but the impact of standard treatment protocols on mutational burden and resulting neoantigen expression in most human cancers is unknown. We sought to quantify the effect of chemotherapy treatment on computationally predicted neoantigen expression for high grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients enrolled in the Australian Ovarian Cancer Study. In this series, 35 of 114 samples were collected after exposure to chemotherapy; 14 are matched with an untreated sample from the same patient. Our approach integrates whole genome and RNA sequencing of bulk tumor samples with class I MHC binding prediction and mutational signatures extracted from studies of chemotherapy-exposed Caenorhabditis elegans and Gallus gallus cells. We additionally investigated the relationship between neoantigens, tumor infiltrating immune cells estimated from RNA-seq with CIBERSORT, and patient survival. Greater neoantigen burden and CD8+ T cell infiltration in primary, pre-treatment samples were independently associated with improved survival. Relapse samples collected after chemotherapy harbored a median of 78{\%} more expressed neoantigens than untreated primary samples, a figure that combines the effects of chemotherapy and other processes operative during relapse. The contribution from chemotherapy-associated signatures was small, accounting for a mean of 5{\%} (range 0–16) of the expressed neoantigen burden in relapse samples. In both treated and untreated samples, most neoantigens were attributed to COSMIC Signature (3), associated with BRCA disruption, Signature (1), associated with a slow mutagenic process active in healthy tissue, and Signature (8), of unknown etiology. Relapsed ovarian cancers harbor more predicted neoantigens than primary tumors, but the increase is due to pre-existing mutational processes, not mutagenesis from chemotherapy.},

abstract = {Robust quantification of immune cell infiltration into the tumor microenvironment may shed light on why only a small proportion of patients benefit from checkpoint therapy. The immune cells surrounding a tumor have been suggested to mediate an effective response to immunotherapy. However, traditional measurement of immune cell content around a tumor by immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, or mass cytometry allows measurement of only up to a few dozen markers at a time, limiting the number of immune cell types identified. Immune cell type abundances may instead be estimated in silico by deconvolving gene expression mixtures from bulk RNA sequencing of tumor tissue. By measuring tens of thousands of transcripts at once, bulk RNA-seq provides a rich input to algorithms that quantify cell type abundances in the tumor microenvironment, affording the potential to quantify the states of a greater number of immune cell types (given adequate training data). Here, we first review existing methods for deconvolution and evaluate their performance on synthetic mixtures. Then we develop a Bayesian inference approach, named infino , that learns to distinguish immune cell expression phenotypes and deconvolve mixtures. In contrast to earlier approaches, infino accepts RNA sequencing data, models transcript expression variability, and exploits the relationships between cell types to improve deconvolution accuracy and allow interrogation from the level of broad categories to the level of finest granularity. The resulting probability distributions of immune infiltration could be applied to numerous questions concerning the diverse ecology of immune cell types, including assessment of the association of immune infiltration with response to immunotherapy, and study of the expression profile and presence of elusive T cell subcompartments, such as T cell exhaustion.},

abstract = {Background Inhibition of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with atezolizumab can induce durable clinical benefit (DCB) in patients with metastatic urothelial cancers, including complete remissions in patients with chemotherapy refractory disease. Although mutation load and PD-L1 immune cell (IC) staining have been associated with response, they lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity for clinical use. Thus, there is a need to evaluate the peripheral blood immune environment and to conduct detailed analyses of mutation load, predicted neoantigens, and immune cellular infiltration in tumors to enhance our understanding of the biologic underpinnings of response and resistance.   Methods and findings The goals of this study were to (1) evaluate the association of mutation load and predicted neoantigen load with therapeutic benefit and (2) determine whether intratumoral and peripheral blood T cell receptor (TCR) clonality inform clinical outcomes in urothelial carcinoma treated with atezolizumab. We hypothesized that an elevated mutation load in combination with T cell clonal dominance among intratumoral lymphocytes prior to treatment or among peripheral T cells after treatment would be associated with effective tumor control upon treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy. We performed whole exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and T cell receptor sequencing (TCR-seq) of pretreatment tumor samples as well as TCR-seq of matched, serially collected peripheral blood, collected before and after treatment with atezolizumab. These parameters were assessed for correlation with DCB (defined as progression-free survival [PFS] {\textgreater}6 months), PFS, and overall survival (OS), both alone and in the context of clinical and intratumoral parameters known to be predictive of survival in this disease state. Patients with DCB displayed a higher proportion of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TIL) (n = 24, Mann-Whitney p = 0.047). Pretreatment peripheral blood TCR clonality below the median was associated with improved PFS (n = 29, log-rank p = 0.048) and OS (n = 29, log-rank p = 0.011). Patients with DCB also demonstrated more substantial expansion of tumor-associated TCR clones in the peripheral blood 3 weeks after starting treatment (n = 22, Mann-Whitney p = 0.022). The combination of high pretreatment peripheral blood TCR clonality with elevated PD-L1 IC staining in tumor tissue was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes (n = 10, hazard ratio (HR) (mean) = 89.88, HR (median) = 23.41, 95{\%} CI [2.43, 506.94], p(HR {\textgreater} 1) = 0.0014). Marked variations in mutation loads were seen with different somatic variant calling methodologies, which, in turn, impacted associations with clinical outcomes. Missense mutation load, predicted neoantigen load, and expressed neoantigen load did not demonstrate significant association with DCB (n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.22, n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.55, and n = 25, Mann-Whitney p = 0.29, respectively). Instead, we found evidence of time-varying effects of somatic mutation load on PFS in this cohort (n = 25, p = 0.044). A limitation of our study is its small sample size (n = 29), a subset of the patients treated on IMvigor 210 (NCT02108652). Given the number of exploratory analyses performed, we intend for these results to be hypothesis-generating.   Conclusions These results demonstrate the complex nature of immune response to checkpoint blockade and the compelling need for greater interrogation and data integration of both host and tumor factors. Incorporating these variables in prospective studies will facilitate identification and treatment of resistant patients.},
