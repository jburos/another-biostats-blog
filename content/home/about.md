# About me

I am a computational biologist and statistician at the [Institute for Next Generation Healthcare](http://www.nextgenhealthcare.org/) at Mt. Sinai Hospital in NYC. Previously I worked as a senior biostatistian at the [Hammer Lab](http://www.hammerlab.org/) with a focus on onco-immunology. In past roles, I have been a Director of Data Science & Strategic Analytics at Penguin Random House, a computational biologist at Boston University, and a clinical researcher at Harvard University.

I am passionate about programming in R, Stan, and to some extent Python in my day-to-day work. I am the author of the Python packages [SurvivalStan](https://jburos.github.io/survivalstan/index.html), [stanity](https://github.com/hammerlab/stanity), and [stancache](https://github.com/hammerlab/stancache). I am a contributor to the R packages [rstanarm](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/) and [GoogleComputeEngineR](https://cloudyr.github.io/googleComputeEngineR/) and to the Python package [cohorts](https://github.com/hammerlab/cohorts).
