 abstract = {Potent antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents have significantly reduced mortality in the setting of acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention. However these agents are associated with increased bleeding which is in turn associated with adverse clinical outcomes. In many centers, transfusion is often used to correct for blood loss. Blood transfusion in the setting of acute coronary syndrome has been associated with adverse clinical outcomes including increased mortality. Transfusion associated microchimerism (TA-MC) is a newly recognized complication of blood transfusion. There is engraftment of the donor's hematopoietic stem cells in patients who then develop microchimerism. This article discusses the association of bleeding/blood transfusion with adverse outcomes and the potential role of TA-MC in clinical outcomes. \textcopyright Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008.},
