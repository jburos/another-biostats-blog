 abstract = {The present study reports outcomes of direct stenting versus conventional stenting, which was performed during adjunctive/rescue percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 556) in the Integrilin and Tenecteplase in Acute Myocardial Infarction trial, the Enoxaparin as Adjunctive Antithrombin Therapy for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 23 trial, and the Fibrinolytic and Aggrastat ST-Elevation Resolution trial of fibrinolytic therapy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Direct stenting was associated with a lower rate of death, myocardial infarction, or congestive heart failure during hospitalization and at 30 days and was independently associated with improved in-hospital outcomes (odds ratio 0.44, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.85, p = 0.014). \textcopyright 2005 by Excerpta Medica Inc.},
