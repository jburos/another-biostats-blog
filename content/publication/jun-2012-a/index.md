abstract = "Objective: To evaluate the association of risk and age at onset (AAO) of Alzheimer disease (AD) with single-ucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the chromosome 19 region including apolipoprotein E (APOE) and a repeatlength polymorphism in TOMM40 (poly-T, rs10524523). Design: Conditional logistic regression models and survival analysis. Setting : Fifteen genome-wide association study data sets assembled by the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium. Participants: Eleven thousand eight hundred forty AD cases and 10 931 cognitively normal elderly controls. Main Outcome Measures: Association of AD risk and AAO with genotyped and imputed SNPs located in an 800-Mb region including APOE in the entire Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set and with the TOMM40 poly-T marker genotyped in a subset of 1256 cases and 1605 controls. Results: In models adjusting for APOE $epsilon$4, no SNPs in the entire region were significantly associated with AAO at P textless .001. Rs10524523 was not significantly associated with AD or AAO in models adjusting for APOE genotype or within the subset of $epsilon$3/$epsilon$3 subjects. Conclusions: APOE alleles $epsilon$2, $epsilon$3, and $epsilon$4 account for essentially all the inherited risk of AD associated with this region. Other variants including a poly-T track in TOMM40 are not independent risk or AAO loci. textcopyright2012 American Medical Association. All rights reserved."
